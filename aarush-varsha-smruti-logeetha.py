# # Tuple

# to store multiple data
# can store duplicate items

# differences
# 1. List -> [] Tuple -> ()
# 2. List is Mutable while tuple is immutable

# eg_list=[34,35,36,37]
# print(eg_list)
# eg_list[2]=45
# print(eg_list)

# eg_tuple=(34,35,36,37)
# print(eg_tuple)
# # eg_tuple[2]=45
# eg_tuple = (34,35,45,37)

# empty_tuple = ()
# mixed_tuple = (1,'Hi',4.45)

# Attributes in list

# eg_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(len(eg_list)) #to find the length of the list
#
# eg_list.append(6) #to add a new item to the list
# print(eg_list)
#
# eg_list.remove(5) #to remove a value from list
# print(eg_list)
#
# print(min(eg_list)) #to find the minimum value in a list
# print(max(eg_list)) #to find the maximum value in a list

# > greater than
print('5 > 3 =',5>3)
print('3 > 5 =',3>5)

# < less than
print('3 < 5 =',3<5)
print('5 < 3 =',5<3)

# == value equals
print('3 == 3',3==3)
print('3 == 5',3==5)

# != value not equals
print('3 != 5',3!=5)
print('3 != 3',3!=3)

# >= greater than or equals
print('5 >= 3',5>=3)
print('5 >= 5',5>=5)
print('3 >= 5',3>=5)

# <= lesser than or equals
print('3 <= 5',3<=5)
print('5 <= 5',5<=5)
print('5 <= 3',5<=3)

# take input from the user asking for his/her birth year
#     calculate the age using that and print a statement
# that says "As your were born in 1994 your age is 30"

# take two inputs both names
# two more inputs storing the heights in cms as integers
# say who is taller "person1 is taller than person2 by ___ cms"
